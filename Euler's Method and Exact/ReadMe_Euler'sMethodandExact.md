# Euler's Method and Exact Equation with 'Sym' Function
This algorithm is used to solve a diffential equation with the Euler's Method numerical solution and an exact solution using the 'sym' function on MATLAB. It will also solve for your percentage error between the numerical solution and the exact solution. If you are to use this code for another equation, simply change the sym fuction to your solution to your differential equation and change the (49-vs(t))/5 to whatever your differential equation is.
### **Remember to change the values to whatever the equation you are using is.**
